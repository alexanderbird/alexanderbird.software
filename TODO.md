# Content
- copyediting all content

# Functional Aesthetics
- in print mode, fit experience to 2 pages
  - apply the compressed tile formatting to mobile views also -- the mixin is already there to use, just set the breakpoints
  - education should not have the tile border -- probably take away the .atoms__card--disable-for-print class and make that implicit

# Prod readiness
- browser compatibility testing & fixes
- social sharing design (e.g. text, twitter)
- copyright notice? Consider the footer on https://philcoffman.com/

# Deployment
- make GitHub public
- update bio sections on professional social media sites
  - Twitter
  - GitHub
  - Stack Overflow
  - others?
- send the "any advice for finding modern agile gigs" tweet

# Nice to have
- add section for youth volunteering experience?
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two?
- revisit all the icons. Are they effective?
- revisit the loading animation. Does it do anything? What if there was no animation? What if it was subtler?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

# TODO

- Mobile view throughout, especially the landing page
- Add links to Hunter blog posts
- Write "What's Next"
- Write "How I Work"
  - consider also the mind map blog post
  - consider having an archive of previous "how I worked" content?


### Maybe

- spruce up the link styles under past/present/future
- Spruce up "Contact Me"
- Add icons for the past/present/future (path/boot/map?)
- Add a "Books and Advice that Shaped Me" page
- Consider revamping that last tile in the work history -- it links to GitHub
  and Stack Overflow... but I don't do a lot of stuff there, right?
    - Maybe have a "portfolio" section with
       - a few notable open source contributions
       - links to regextiles and other games

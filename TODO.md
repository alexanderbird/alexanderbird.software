# Content
- copyediting all content
  - in print mode, somehow get education on first three pages (instead of on the 4th page)

# Look & Feel
- Revise the experience intro section in web view

# Prod readiness (after initial deploy)
- browser compatibility testing & fixes
- social sharing design (e.g. text, twitter)
- redirect www to bar domain

# Post-deployment
- update bio sections on professional social media sites
  - Twitter
  - GitHub
  - Stack Overflow
  - others?
- send the "any advice for finding modern agile gigs" tweet

# Nice to have
- better social sharing photo -- with less cropping of the forehead/chin
- add section for youth volunteering experience?
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two?
- revisit all the icons. Are they effective?
- revisit the loading animation. Does it do anything? What if there was no animation? What if it was subtler?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

- update skills sections with new content
- make experience tiles pretty
- experience tiles' breakpoint for switching to column view is off. This might not be the case after redesigning that tile
- make github public and add link to it?
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two? Also include them in the assets folder instead of hot linking?
- copyediting all content
- prettier print mode
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

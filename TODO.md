# Content
- copyediting all content

# Functional Aesthetics
- prettier print mode
  - fit intro to one page (can you inline the short bullets in tech excellence?)
  - fit experience to 1.5 pages, preferably 1
    - the changes made for this should also work for mobile
    - *HEY* this means the zero padding change for the tech stack thing should be a media query, not the print mode
  - links should not be styled differently (you can't click them on paper)

# Prod readiness
- browser compatibility testing & fixes
- social sharing design (e.g. text, twitter)

# Deployment
- make GitHub public
- update bio sections on professional social media sites
  - Twitter
  - GitHub
  - Stack Overflow
  - others?
- send the "any advice for finding modern agile gigs" tweet

# Nice to have
- add section for youth volunteering experience?
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two?
- revisit all the icons. Are they effective?
- revisit the loading animation. Does it do anything? What if there was no animation? What if it was subtler?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

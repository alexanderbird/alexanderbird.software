# Content
- copyediting all content
- make GitHub public

# Functional Aesthetics
- prettier print mode

# Nice to have
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two? Also include them in the assets folder instead of hot linking?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

# Content
- copyediting all content
- make GitHub public

# Functional Aesthetics
- prettier print mode
- print and contact icons are lower on the screen, what's up with that?
- mail icon's weight doesn't match print icon
- maybe no "Motivation" in the intro section

# Prod readiness
- browser compatibility testing & fixes

# Nice to have
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two? Also include them in the assets folder instead of hot linking?
- revisit all the icons. Are they effective?
- revisit the loading animation. Does it do anything? What if there was no animation? What if it was subtler?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

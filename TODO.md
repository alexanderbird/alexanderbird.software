# Browser compatibility
- firefox
  - initial animation didn't tween properly -- three awkward jumps
  - print seems to completely ignore the print view
- safari
  - print page breaks aren't working

# Post-deployment
- update bio sections on professional social media sites
  - Twitter
  - GitHub
  - Stack Overflow
  - others?
- send the "any advice for finding modern agile gigs" tweet

# Nice to have
## Look & Feel
- Revise the experience intro section in web view
- better social sharing photo -- with less cropping of the forehead/chin
- revisit the type faces. Also maybe have two?
- update the contact modal -- add some generic modal stuff: grey out the background, click or (or Escape key?) to close

## Animations/transitions
- revisit the loading animation. Does it do anything? What if there was no animation? What if it was subtler?
- revisit the transition animations for to/from contact modal, to/from print mode

## Content
- add section for youth volunteering experience?

        title: Helping Others
        details: I'm motivated by making other people's lives better with software.
      values:
        - deploy early and often
        - building mechanisms to accept and adapt to user feedback
        - build the features that provide business value
        - make room on the development team for everyone to contribute

    - motivation:
        title: Doing a Good Job
        details: |
          I wish this went without saying, but it doesn't. When we say "yes" to
          everything, we can't do a good job. When we believe that cutting
          corners on maintainability reduces our overall cost, we can't do a
          good job. I'm motivated when our team is expected to deliver excellent
          results quickly by whatever processes and tools we find work best in
          our current context.
      values:
        - measure outcomes instead of developer activities
        - specify the problem (not the tasks to complete)
        - work in small batches; reevaluate process/tools regularly based on results
        - finish the current goal before starting new work
        - devote time to improvement (instead of always rushing and never going faster)

      strengths:
        - slicing large requirements into small experiments
        - working to understand the human/business context
        - helping the team develop a shared understanding of the problem
        - requirements gathering, design, modelling

    - motivation:
        title: Go Well to Go Fast
        details: |
          I'm motivated when we spend an appropriate amount of time to test, architect,
          and document what we build. I have found this pays for itself now, and helps
          us in the future
      values:
        - coding for humans to read
        - coding so it's easy to operate
        - coding so it's easy to change when we learn
        - Domain Driven Design
      strengths:
        - main: building with quality
          collapsible: true
          sub:
            - TDD / <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864'>TCR</a>
            - Domain Driven Design so the code matches the business rules
            - safe <a target='_blank' href='https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html'>refactoring</a>
        - main: learning quickly
          collapsible: true
          sub:
            - Behavior Driven Design -- stakeholder-readable tests
            - quick experiments and data gathering
            - facilitating discussions to get the best out of everyone present
            - reading (docs, code)

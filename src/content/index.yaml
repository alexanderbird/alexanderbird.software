      - "Built an import utility for a proprietary data format: inferred the domain model/rules from the data, wrote a custom parser."
      - Integrated this component with our client's code
      - Provided extensive documentation and training so their development team was comfortable maintaining the import utility.

    comments:
      - When our client pivoted significantly two months in (new UI, new data model), the architecture and tests I had put in place allowed me to salvage most of the existing code.
      - Communicated respectfully and constructively with our client despite their ad hominem attacks and disrespectful attitude.

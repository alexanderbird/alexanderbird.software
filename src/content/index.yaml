    values:
      - main: make room for innovation
        sub:
          - agree on and specify the problem (instead of controlling/constraining solutions)

      - when the problem isn't technical, our approach should reflect that
      - regularly spend time getting faster instead of rushing inefficiently

        &mdash; not based on my personal interest.
    values:
      - you can have quick features and maintainability when you practice good design
      - small units of work make for earlier feedback and a better product
      - reduce risk by preparing for the unexpected (instead of trying to predict the future)
    strengths:
      - main: building with quality
        sub:

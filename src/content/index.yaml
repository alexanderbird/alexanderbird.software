    - motivation:
        title: Helping Others
        details: I'm motivated by making other people's lives better with software.
      values:
        - deploy early and often
        - ask users for feedback
        - build the features that provide business value
        - make room on the development team for everyone to contribute
      strengths:
        - main: communication
          collapsible: true
          sub:
            - listening
            - discussion facilitation
            - documentation writing
        - teaching
        - pair programming / mobbing / collaborative code reviews
        - leadership

    - motivation:
        title: Innovation
        # Whereas some organizations require one to ask permission before deviating from standardized processes and tools.
        details: |
          I'm motivated when there is room for innovation: when our team is expected
          to deliver excellent results quickly by whatever processes and tools we find
          work best in the current context.
      values:
        - measure outcomes instead of developer activities
        - specify the problem (not the tasks to complete)
        - work in small batches; reevaluate process/tools regularly based on results
        - devote time to improvement (instead of always rushing and never going faster)

      strengths:
        - requirements gathering, design, modelling
        - slicing large requirements into small experiments
        - working to understand the human/business context
        - communicating the problem to everyone on the team

    - motivation:
        title: Technical Excellence
        details: |
          I'm motivated when we spend an appropriate amount of time to test, architect,
          and document what we build. I have found this pays for itself now, and helps
          us in the future, because well-written software is:
      values:
        - faster to write
        - cheaper to maintain
        - less stressful to work with
        - easier to re-purpose when plans change
      strengths:
        - main: building with quality

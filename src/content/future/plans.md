For some time now, I have been practising these skills by initiative. In my next
role, I would like some or all of them to be my stated responsibilities.

- **Engineering strategy** to reconcile business goals with technical constraints
  - Finding a "3rd option" when business and tech needs seem to contradict
      - Option 1: ignore the market pressure (e.g. pause features for a while,
        gambling against our business experts' judgment)
      - Option 2: ignore the software developers' concerns (gambling against our
        engineers' judgment)
      - Option 3: this is the hard part (ask me about some "third options" I
        have come up with in the past)
  - Translating the strategy into actionable first steps for engineering
  - Translating the strategy into measurable targets for executives
- **Technical excellence**, training, and bar raising
  - Identifying gaps in our delivery, operational, and security engineering
    practices
  - Communicate with executives about the risk and opportunity
    - collaborate to assess whether this needs addressing now, later, or never
  - Design measurable targets and metrics to drive the improvement
  - Teach, coach, guide, review, and support engineers towards the goal
- **Engineering culture** -- coaching collaborative, high-safety software development
    - Using established and novel techniques for working together better
    - Proactively improving the communication and collaboration
    - Providing as-needed facilitation to navigate challenging collaboration
      situations
- **Operational excellence** - reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of
  operational incidents by driving culture and process changes
    - By leading root causes analysis from single incidents to the system-wide
      forces that make it possible
        - Distinguish between emerging trends and one-off incidents to triage
          our improvements where they count
    - By working with engineers to improve tools and processes
    - By designing and providing training and instruction to help engineers
      identify and mitigate these issues before production

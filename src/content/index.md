I **lead teams** from within. I want to **be better at building software** next month
than I was this month, and I want to **help my software organization** do the same.

I **code**, I **coach**, I **read**, I **write**, I **experiment**. I love **being
corrected** and having my assumptions challenged.

I make the **work fun** so I can work my hardest. I **work hard** to keep the
work fun.

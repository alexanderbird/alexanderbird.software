I **lead teams** from within. I want to **be better at building software** next month
than I was this month, and I want to **help my software organization** do the same.

I **code**, I **coach**, I **read**, I **write**, I **experiment**. I love **being
corrected** and having my assumptions challenged.

I make the **work fun** so I can work my hardest. I **work hard** to keep the
work fun.

For **direction**, I'm guided by a deep care for customers and a respect for the
judgment of our business' leaders. For **speed**, I invest in technical excellence,
collaboration, and mentoring my more junior teammates with the hope that they
overtake me.

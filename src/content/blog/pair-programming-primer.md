Pair programming, when done poorly, can be:
  - exhausting
  - uncomfortably intimate
  - generally unpleasant

Here are some points to cover when introducing pairing to make it a positive
experience:

### Collaboration

- **Not just watching me code**
  - For a thought to go from your head into the computer, it must pass through
   someone else's hands.
  - If you're at the keyboard and have an idea, pass the keyboard to your pair
    and walk them through it (instead of "just a sec." and then you're off in
    your own world).
  - Llewelyn Falco describes this as ["Strong style
    pairing"](http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.com/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html).
- **Disagreements: just try something**
  - When you disagree about approach, don't debate; choose one person's approach
   (preferably the most junior of the pair) and try it out. If they're wrong,
   reality will prove it. If they're right, you just learned something.
  - This is discussed in [this
    anecdote](https://twitter.com/marick/status/1103332398165622784).
  - See also: Llewelyn Falco's "Strong style pairing" article (linked above), in
    the "Ask for trust" section near the end.
- **Attribution in version control**
  - Update your git config so both pairs' names appear in the git log.
    - `git config --global user.name "Alex B. and Sarah L."`

### Comfort
- **Attend to your personal needs**
  - You can get up and leave whenever you want, without offering an explanation.
  - Consider using Pomodoros: 25 minutes of work, 3 minutes off.
  - Unless you firmly establish this as your policy, you are likely to "power
    through" when you feel you need a break because of some imagined social
    expectation &mdash; you'll end up needlessly tired and ineffective.
- **Ergonomics**
  - When you take your turn at the keyboard, take a moment to place it fully in
    front of you (instead of leaning awkwardly out of your seat).
- Hygiene
  - Sit somewhere where you're not rubbing shoulders and coughing on each other
  - Consider keeping a bottle of hand sanitizer to use when handing off the
    keyboard

### Customization
- **Retrospect**
  - Chat about what is and isn't working; adjust to suit.
  - Consider [this overview of a variety of pairing
    techniques](https://builttoadapt.io/whats-the-best-way-to-pair-a8699f9beb81)
    which may give you more ideas of things to try
  - Also, [Woody Zuill's very comprehensive experience report on Mob
   Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/mob-programming-agile2014/)
   has a lot of great material which applies equally well to pairing

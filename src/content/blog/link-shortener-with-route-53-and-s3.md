A short educational project to:
 - familiarize myself with CloudFormation
 - have an excuse to buy a new domain name (invisi.link)
 - satisfy my curiosity about a pure DNS link shortener
   - (the TL;DR is "no" -- you can't put protocols and paths in a DNS entry so
     the DNS entries alone aren't enough...  but my concession was to use
     Route53 + S3 so the shortened links are all stored as DNS records.)

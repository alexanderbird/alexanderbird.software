Running-Tested-Stories:
  - running ("it can be demonstrated live")
  - tested ("high quality and user accepted)


> Running Tested Stories is the only metric that reliably describes the progress

> Exactly! We have done a lot of work, and we've started many things. But the

About "scope creep"
> Of course, that name does not reflect the reality of software development.
> Adding work to the backlog is not "scope creep", it is just a natural outcome
> of our constantly changing and improving understnding of the problems we need
> to solve with the software we are creating. Instead of "scope creep", we
> should really use the term "value discovered". Loc 1819


> The moment you realize that a Feature or a User Story cannot be fully
> delivered within the allotted time is the moment you get to decide whether to
> accept that additional work or to discard it. That is a *powerful moment* in
> your effort to contain the project scope and focus on the most valuable work.
> Why wouldn't you *use it*? Loc 1842


> scope management in a project is one of the few things the project team really

> or even Story-level functionality at the end of the project, but I'm sure they
> will consider your suggestions if you bring them early enough in the project.

> 1. Use multiple levels of granularity to establish flexible requirements.
> 2. Use historical data to assess progress and forecast future delivery.
> 3. Cost is a multiplier of time (mostly); the only real variable the project
>    team can control actively is value (in the form of scope).

> "Carmen, I'm sure you mean well. And I'm sure that whatever ideas Herman has
> told you they have only helped you realize that you needed to work harder.
> This #NoEstimates is simply not credible! Why do you think I transferred

Related to user story mapping, or a "matrix"
> Carmen needs to start considering all the possible dimensions of scope before
> she is able to realize that, even fixed scope projects, can have a lot of
> flexibility in the list of requirements, if that list is expressed as a
> two-dimensional matrix of Features and User Stories.


> You have to continue that discussion and find the right Features to remove. It
> will not be easy, but the alternative is certain failure. And no one, not even
> the client, wants that." Loc 2128


> Typically projects tend to balloon in scope, because we discover functionality
> at lower levels of abstraction that we consider 'important', and just add to
> the backlog. However, we can use the same approach to remove items from the
> backlog. Think of it like negative scope creep. Loc 2209

**Independent** (can be implemented independently of other stories)  
**Negotiable** (don't dictate implementation strategy)  
**Valuable** (to the customer)  
**Essential** (absolutely required for the product to be viable)  
**Small** (well understood by the team and can be implemented in a short time
frame  
**Testable** (includes a set of criteria that the define when the story is done)  


Goal: "clear & verifiable progress information; actionable information"


> By creating a detailed plan, Carmen was about to commit the work of the team
> for the next few weeks. Once that commitment was made (and the implicit
> promise to Mr. McNeal), the team would no longer have the option to adapt to
> new information. All the assumptions, sequence of work, dependency handling,
> risks and errors would be locked in. She would have removed all flexibility
> from her project. Loc 2422


> Independently of what decision Mr. McNeal will make, the cost to produce the
> forecast is very low, and the information it provides will be enough for him
> to make a decision. Loc 2435


> Your goal should be to make changes to the plans easier. Why? The simpler the
> planning process, the faster and more easily your projects will be able to
> accommodate the inevitable changes. Loc 2441

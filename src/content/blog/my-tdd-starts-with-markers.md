Sometimes I hear from coworkers who don't practice TDD

 > TDD doesn't work for me because I don't know where to start.

And from others

 > Huh, you sure do a lot of whiteboarding and paper &amp; pencil work before
 > you start typing.

I think the two are related: for my, my TDD starts with markers. I don't start
typing until I have a clear idea of the major components and their relationships
with each other.

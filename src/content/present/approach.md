The software we build is too complicated to build alone.

Most of my leadership effort goes into bringing the full weight of our
collective ability -- all of us -- to bear on the problem at hand.

### Communication

We need input from engineers, executives, stakeholders, and customers to do our
work well. Because of that, I pay attention to:

1. Frequent delivery to get feedback from stakeholders and customers
    - I know the frustration of building for months and discovering it's the wrong
      thing, and we could have known it a few weeks in if we'd structured the work
      differently. Now, I work hard to avoid that waste by structuring the tech
      and the goals so we can validate a small piece at a time.
2. Strategic domain driven design so the engineers speak the same language as the
   stakeholders and customers
    - I know the futility of working for early feedback but having the essential
      advice lost in translation -- which we discover months later. "I told you X"
      -- "I thought that meant Y" -- and so we waste our time. Now, I do my best
      to deal with the human-to-human translation issues at their root by taking
      time early on to agree on what we call things, and to express that in the
      code and in our communication. We need all our minds' engaged on the work,
      and constant translation is taxing like bartering in a foreign currency,
      doing the conversion in your head after every counter. We can avoid this by
      taking a little time to talk semantics and then bake the right terms and
      ideas into our code.
3. Technical practices to reduce cognitive load (so we can whole-brain one thing
   instead of half-braining two things).
    - code structure, testing strategy, tool choice, automation, just enough
      documentation, etc.
4. Social practices to make space for healthy debate
    - We can't do creative work well when we are in fight-or-flight mode. I have
      seen engineering cultures where truth matters more than delivery (which
      seems like it would be efficient but turns out to shut down discussion),
      and others where delivery trumps all (even if we say nothing, to our
      detriment).
       - I earn trust, facilitate working agreements, coach
         [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach),
         model humility and
         saying sorry, and I have hard conversations when they're needed

### Technology

- Keep it as boring as possible
- Make intentional choices
- Move fast on reversible decisions (and slower on those that are harder to
  change)
- Design just enough to know where to start; build just enough to know what's
  missing from the design; repeat
- It's not done until we know it works (which probably means it's covered by
  automated tests and deployed to production with appropriate metrics to see
  that customers are using it and that it's going ok)
- We can't know it's tested unless we practice TDD (or run mutation testing
  tooling regularly -- but I haven't seen anyone run those since my testing
  course in university)


### Product

I prefer to work on products where we prioritize quality over the number of
features -- I want to do good work, which means I need to work in an environment
where customers want good work. I respect that there are markets where customers
care more about low cost than high quality, and I choose to avoid working in
those environments.

On the other hand, whatever we build, we build to sell or serve to others --
let's pay close attention to "good enough" and avoid building extra that nobody
needs (but somebody would have to pay for). The best way I've found to do this
is to build in small steps to unlock the next step in the user's workflow, as
described in [User Story Mapping (Jeff Patton)](https://jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/)

### Mentoring

The best way I've found to get excellent senior engineers is to train junior
engineers. The best way I've found to do that is to give them as much
responsibility as they can handle (maybe a little more), and to coach them
through the challenge. I do this with their permission, in proportion to their
level of interest and aligned to the direction they want to take their career.

I have an imaginary "coach vs deliver" dial in my mind (imagine a spedometor),
and the more urgent our business need, or the larger our undelivered inventory,
the more I shift from "coach" to "deliver". With a delivery focus, I am
comfortable stepping in more often with concrete direction. With a coaching
focus, I make space for less experienced developers to do more exploration on
their own. In that coaching mode, I'm more guiding than directing. When business
constraints force me into delivery mode, I work hard to deliver and get quickly
back to coaching mode.

If we are feeling the delivery pressure, then we could use a few more
independent and skilled developers -- so the coaching is especially important. I
do as much of it as I can, as often as I can, while respecting the current
urgent needs.

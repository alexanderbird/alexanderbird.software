I work remotely from Kimberley, BC.

The Canadian Rockies International Airport (YXC) is a short drive from me and has
direct flights to Vancouver and Calgary, so I can fly to those cities for team
events as needed.

(By my calculations, the carbon emissions for one flight per month from here to
Vancouver are approximately equal to the carbon emissions from a month's worth
of 30-minute daily commutes by car.)
